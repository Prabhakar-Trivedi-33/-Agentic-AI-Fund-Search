 core/ — Core Configuration & Utilities
This folder contains the essential setup and shared utilities for the project, including:

 API Keys & Environment Config
Configuration using BaseSettings from Pydantic to load values from .env.

LLM Client Setup
Code to connect with OpenAI (or a mock) for handling AI-powered answers.

Common utilities
Any helper functions or shared logic used across the app.

Examples of what lives here:

config.py – loads settings like OpenAI API keys and base URLs.

llm.py – a wrapper around OpenAI’s chat API.

logging.py (optional) – custom logging config.

This keeps your app clean, centralized, and easy to manage.
