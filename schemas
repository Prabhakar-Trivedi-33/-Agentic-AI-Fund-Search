 schemas/ — Data Models (Pydantic)
This folder contains the Pydantic models that define the structure of data used in requests and responses.

These models help:

✅ Validate incoming API data

✅ Document the API using FastAPI’s automatic docs

✅ Keep your code clean and consistent

For example:

FundSearchRequest – structure for /funds/search query

CompareRequest – input for comparing funds

AIQueryRequest – structure for the /ai/query input

FundResponse – what the API returns about a mutual fund

These models make sure the app knows what kind of data it’s working with at every step.
