services/ — External API Integration
This folder contains all the code that talks to external services, especially MFAPI.in.

It acts like a bridge between your app and external data.

Here’s what typically goes here:

mfapi.py – Functions to:

1.Search mutual funds by name

2. Get details of a mutual fund by scheme code

3. Compare multiple mutual funds

These service functions are used by your agents and API routes to get real-time data from mfapi.in.

By keeping them in one place, it's easy to update or switch APIs later without touching other parts of the app.
